### Purpose

This application provides a means to search for Google Books. Once a book is found, it displays information about the book -- including a summary and the author's name -- and posts a link to the book. It also employs a database to allow users to store a list of books.

### Functionality

This application uses React to display components and to maintain state. It also uses a MongoDB database.

### Concepts and techniques
* React
* MongoDB
